Such a discovery process demands an in-depth understanding of the roles and interrelationships between the crystal structure, defect chemistry, microstructure, and texture in such materials. Statistical thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and solid mechanics principles will be used as and when necessary in the course. The course is intended to fit in the space and act as a bridge between solid state theory where the emphasis is largely on theory and a ceramic materials course where the emphasis is largely on processing. Same as ENG ME 781. Students may not receive credits for both."
ENG,ENG MS 782: Advanced Materials Characterization,"This course will discuss the characterization of materials' atomic and electronic structure. Atomic structure evaluation by x-ray diffraction, selected area- and convergent-beam electron diffraction; microstructure evaluation by transmission electron microscopy, principles of bright-field, dark-field and weak-beam imaging; principles of analytical electron microscopy using EDS, WDS, AES; study of chemical and bonding states by EELS, Raman spectroscopy and XPS/ESCA; laser-based non-destructive evaluation of mechanical properties of materials. Characterization methods for semiconductors include the study of point defects by electron paramagnetic resonance, of transport properties by magnetoresistance and Hall effect, of recombination phenomena by photoluminescennce and of junction properties by capacitance-voltage methods."
ENG,ENG MS 810: PhD Internship in Material Science & Engineering,Graduate Prerequisites: Permission of advisor and an approved internship offer; at least two c omplete semesters in the SE PhD program. - This course provides MSE PhD students the opportunity to include a paid internship as part of their professional training. The internship must be related to the student's are of study. International students require CPT authorization. Written summary required. Graded P/F. Prerequisite: Permission of advisor and an approved internship offer; at least two complete semesters in the MSE PhD program. Full-time (30-40 hours/week for at least 12 weeks) = 4 credits; part-time (15-20 hours/week for at least 12 weeks) = 2 credits.
ENG,ENG MS 900: PhD Research,Undergraduate Prerequisites: Graduate standing. - Graduate Prerequisites: Restricted to pre-prospectus PhD students. - Participation in a research project under the direction of a faculty advisor leading to the preparation and defense of a PhD prospectus.
ENG,ENG MS 925: No Longer Offered,No longer offered
ENG,ENG MS 951: Independent Study,"Undergraduate Prerequisites: By petition only - Graduate students may study, under a faculty member's supervision, subjects not covered in a regularly offered course. Final report and/or written examination normally required."
ENG,ENG MS 952: MS Mentored Project,"Students who are pursuing a project to satisfy their practicum requirement for the MS without Thesis and MEng degrees will register for up to 4 credits of this course. The course may be taken more than once up to four credits (ex. two credits in Fall, two credits in Spring). Students will select a suitable project, with a mentor, that can be completed in 4 credits. The Graduate Committee must approve all proposed projects. Each student must write a project report at the end of the course that will be graded P/F by their project mentor."
ENG,ENG MS 954: MS Thesis,Undergraduate Prerequisites: Graduate standing. - Graduate Prerequisites: Restricted to MS students by petition only. - Participation in a research project under the direction of a faculty advisor leading to the preparation of an original MS thesis. For students pursuing an MS thesis to satisfy the practicum requirement for the MS degree.
ENG,ENG MS 991: PhD Dissertation,Undergraduate Prerequisites: Graduate standing. - Graduate Prerequisites: MS 900; restricted to post-prospectus PhD students. - Participation in a research project under the direction of a faculty advisor leading to the preparation and defense of an original PhD dissertation.
