Outside subject matter experts join the classroom to discuss their real-world involvement in climate change and public health."
SPH,SPH EH 722: Climate Change and Health Equity,"The root causes and upstream drivers of climate change and health inequities are often the same. Our energy, transportation, land use, building, food and agriculture and socioeconomic systems are key contributors to the pollution that leads to anthropogenic climate change and, at the same time, shape our urban and rural communities and living conditions. Global impacts of climate change on health are moderated by individual and community vulnerability and resilience. Health impacts may differ by place, race and income as a result of factors such as inequities in the distribution of economic power, historical disinvestment in some communities, discriminatory practices and policies over time, structural racism, higher pollution burdens and poor access to resources for health benefits and improvement. As a result, certain groups including children, the elderly, and communities of color are less climate-resilient and more vulnerable to the negative health effects of climate change. This course will explore the interconnections between climate change, health, and equity, with a particular focus on upstream interventions to mitigate climate impacts that may have co-benefits for health and equity. We will rely on examples within the US as well as globally, to provide multiple perspectives including from the global south."
SPH,SPH EH 727: Incorporating Health to Design Healthy and Sustainable Climate Solutions,"Despite the fact that the climate warming effects of carbon dioxide were discovered in 1856, policy action has been inadequate to reduce anthropogenic drivers of climate change. Emissions from the energy, transportation, building and agricultural sectors contribute to climate change; these sectors also contribute heavily to other harms to health, including through air pollution, physical inactivity, inadequate nutrition, and others. This class will use Health Impact Assessment, Risk and Exposure Assessment, and Life Cycle Assessment to explore how different societal and economic sectors contribute to climate change, positive and negative health implications of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from these sectors, and measures to help society adapt to climate change. We will then give students training in climate communication, policy, and politics to enable results to be used in climate policymaking.

SPH,SPH GH 765: Global Mental Health,"Mental health is relatively new to the global health agenda. At the 54th World Health Assembly in 2001, the WHO and health ministers from around the world made an impassioned argument that mental health disorders be systematically measured and addressed in all countries. Since then critical progress has been made in understanding the global burden of mental illness and the challenges faced by those in need of care in low and middle-income countries or in contexts marked by armed conflict or natural disasters. Likewise, the role of culture in defining ways in which mental illness manifests itself has been incorporated into international diagnostic manuals. Nevertheless, change has been slow and many who need mental health services continue to go without diagnosis or treatment and confront ongoing stigma and discrimination. Class sessions and assignments provide students with a chance to explore the critical role played by the social, cultural, and economic context in shaping mental health and illness."
SPH,SPH GH 766: Sexual and Reproductive Health in Disaster Settings,"Disasters (natural and armed conflicts) pose various negative health outcomes to affected populations.

SPH,SPH PM 834: Planning and Regulating to Fix Health Care,"Graduate Prerequisites: SPHPH719 or consent of instructor. - Failures of competitive markets in health care have sparked public planning and regulation. But these, in turn, have not been very successful in addressing problems of access, cost, appropriateness/quality, or caregiver configuration. Examining cases of persisting health problems such as childhood lead poisoning and quality of nursing home care, this course dissects what has worked and why. We consider ways in which planning can be a guide to effective action, not a pretext for inaction. We examine ways to quantify harm caused by a problem, analyze causes of the harm, develop policies and programs to address those causes, and analyze the efficacy, cost, political feasibility, and managerial feasibility of specific programs. Each student prepares a realistic plan, grounded in evidence, to ameliorate harm to people's health caused by a persisting threat."

SPH,SPH PM 839: Implementation Science: Linking Research to Practice,"Implementation science is commonly defined as the study of methods and strategies to promote the uptake of interventions that have proven effective in routine practice, with the aim of improving population health. Often interventions tested in traditional research studies that are found to be effective do not translate into positive outcomes in practice or cannot be practically applied. Alternatively, other interventions that have potential to improve care will not the effectively implemented without practical tools to aid the implementation. Integrating research into practice is a major challenge, both during the period of a study and beyond. This course will address the complexities of integrating research and practice and of translating research into practice. Students will learn about the background and concepts of implementation research and implementation science and how they fit into health services research, key components of implementation research proposal and how they are reviewed, what evidence is in an evidence- based intervention and how evidence is identified and evaluated, frameworks to guide implementation studies, different implementation study designs, implementation outcomes, and about how to balance intervention fidelity with feasibility, as well as how interventions can be adapted for different populations and settings."

The course will integrate multiple skill sets, including quantitative modelling, statistical programming, research design, and proposal writing."
SPH,SPH PM 851: Organizing and Advocacy for Health Policy Change,"Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PH719 - There is abundant evidence in public health that one of the most effective ways to improve population health is by changing the policies and structures that set the contexts in which people make their decisions about health, and through which they access their health care. To change these policies and structures, public health professionals should be familiar with existing techniques and technologies for mobilizing and expressing popular support and pressure within existing policy frameworks that often seem unresponsive to community-based public health concerns. This course introduces students to two key areas of knowledge in public health practice: 1) the principles and methods of community organizing and 2) campaigning for policy and structural change. A series of short assignments culminates in a final product: the creation of a campaign plan for changing public policy regarding a specific public health problem. Students will also choose an actual policy campaign, volunteer with that campaign, and use the course materials to reflect critically on their campaign experience."
SPH,SPH PM 864: Contemporary Structures of Health Services,"This course is designed to provide an introduction to the objects of inquiry in health services research: the structures of health services that are the sites of organized processes that produce health outcomes.

You will identify and practice techniques for measuring LGBTQ populations as well as ways to better recognize the assets that are found within these communities. Today, data on these populations are increasingly collected in the context of public health surveillance and also some health care facilities have begun recording these data in medical records, yet access to these data is still mostly restricted. While recognizing the limitations of available data sources, you will make use of publicly available data to characterize quantitatively and qualitatively the diversity of LGBTQ populations. Course readings, class lectures, and exercises will be used throughout the course to analyze and discuss the micro and macro determinants of LGBTQ populations' health. You will build skills by utilizing secondary data, performing a content analysis, conducting a key informant interview, and by producing a final paper, which analyzes the literature on a LGBTQ health topic of their choice for the purpose of proposing next steps in research or program development for the LGBTQ community."

SPH,"SPH SB 785: Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Use: People, Populations and Policies","Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PH720 or instructor permission. - Alcohol, tobacco and other drug (ATOD) use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Because virtually everyone has some experience with ATOD use themselves or in others, much about this topic is thought to be common knowledge, but in this course students will be surprised at the depth of scientific knowledge known that is not widely understood, in part evidenced by common policies and approaches that are not evidence-based. This course asks students to critically examine current ATOD research, policy and intervention and prevention practice, with the goal of acquiring skills with which to improve strategies to reduce ATOD-related consequences, illness and injury. Specifically, students will become well-versed in models for understanding ATOD use; gain knowledge in ATOD use across multiple populations and throughout the lifespan; understand contemporary public health debates regarding ATOD research and prevention strategies; learn how to address the deficiencies in current public health approaches to ATOD use; and be able to apply knowledge to emerging public health problems."
SPH,SPH SB 806: Designing Strategic Interventions and Communications to Advance Public Health,"Graduate Prerequisites: SPH PH720 or instructor permission. - This core communications course focuses on 1) the development of an evidence- informed and innovative intervention and 2) the execution of a strategic and creative communications plan for a public health organization that is responsible for the intervention developed. The course also features a review of basic theory and research that can inform the health communications process as well as strategies for accessing the literature. Students are assigned a public health problem faced by a public health agency, and consult with the public health agency throughout the semester. Working through a sequence of written assignments, students conduct a literature review to inform an intervention plan and then prepare several materials to execute a communications strategy in support of the intervention. Communication pieces may include, but are not limited to: press release, letter to the editor, pitch letter with infographic, editorial, social media, video, website wireframes, texting campaigns and mHealth, videos, and press event. Writing workshops in class, skill-based exercises, and consultations with the teaching team and stakeholders are designed to give students ideas for their projects, interim feedback on their written assignments, and tools necessary to successfully develop and present a product that can be implemented by the public health agency. Students present their final project to the class and to the public health agency."
