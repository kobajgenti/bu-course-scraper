CFA,CFA AR 600: Contemporary Issues in Art Education (4 credits),"With an arts-research approach, this course allows students to explore and respond to contemporary issues while developing their own craft and building a creative learning community. The course surveys the roots of contemporary art and pedagogy and the shift to postmodernism, including influential figures, theories, and trends and their impact on art education. A deep-dive investigation into masks as universal but complex, culturally-embedded phenomena provides students in the course with a unique lens. Students investigate the popularity of masks in global contemporary art and the roots of these masks that speak to culture, identity, privacy, and other issues of the moment. Responding to course content by creating art, students stretch and expand their knowledge of the mask form and use it as a tool to examine pressing issues in the contemporary art classroom. The in-depth focus enriches the background, ideas, and approaches teachers can bring to mask making, a valuable but often challenging project, but also use as a model. Through e-portfolio and online discussions, students create a community of learners. A culminating project, such as a unit plan or autoethnography, synthesizes traditional research methods with arts-research insights and tackles the complexities that arise in a multi-cultural curriculum, such as appropriation, transnationalism, and ahistoricism."

CFA,CFA AR 625: Artist and the Book,"""Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some are to be chewed and digested."" ~Francis Bacon, Essays (1625) Bacon's Essays By Francis Bacon, Richard Whately. Artists Books are conceived as works of art in their own right. This course offers graduate students a comprehensive introduction to artist books and bookmaking, both historical and contemporary, utilizing various technical processes for eastern and western book forms, adhesive and non-adhesive bindings, enclosures, and experimental book forms. What truly makes an artist's book is the artist's intent. Artists' books exist at the intersections of printmaking, photography, poetry, experimental narrative, visual arts, graphic design, and publishing. Students will be expected to research how a book augments their studio practice and how word and image are particularly important in expressing ideas that further their goals as an artist. In all cases content, form and materials must work together in creating a complete work. Regular critiques, both individual and group, will emphasize learning goals. Students are encouraged to include various mediums in book format, whether two or three dimensional, and to expand the boundaries of their process in new ways. Guest artists, trips to artist book collections, studio visits, and student presentations will be featured."
CFA,CFA AR 630: Child Growth and Development in Art Education (4 credits),"This course will examine the cognitive and artistic development of children, specifically focusing on the role of environment and culture in shaping the child and the layered integrations they form over time.

Students will be expected to use modes of inquiry and research based on these new methods to determine how they support individual expression and begin to question and further the personal goals in a student's practice. Group and individual critiques will occur; the emphasis is on drawing and image development, technical knowledge, and professional practices. Projects may span media to build a group of related prints. Presentations on the historical and contemporary print and its culture, visiting artists, museum and studio visits provide context to contemporary printmaking."
CFA,CFA AR 648: Lithography 4,"This graduate course is open to those who have lithography experience as well as to those for whom this is a first-time foray into its history, techniques, and processes. Lithography is one of the oldest printmaking mediums, but perhaps the most versatile. It can mimic a pastel drawing, a watercolor, a fine line engraving or a photograph, utilizing both traditional stone as well as aluminum plates and other substrates. The intrinsic nature of a print involves drawing, creating multiples, opacities and transparencies utilizing various materials as drawing tools. Color layering and sequences, building upon an image and taking it away again, all lead to the versatility of the medium. Color mixing, ink modification, registration and the printing of multiple-run lithographs will be taught, with an emphasis on experimentation in size, series, and thinking beyond the flat surface. A disciplined approach to cooperative print shop use, how a professional print atelier runs, and proper care and maintenance of equipment will be covered. Students will build confidence in printing editions, working collaboratively with invited artists, and developing work that supports and extends their overall studio practice. Critiques, both one-on-one and in groups, combined with presentations on well-known artists, visits to professional print ateliers and print collections, and guest speakers will showcase current trends in the medium and its part in the contemporary printmaking landscape."

CFA,CFA FA 510: Art Leaders Forum,"The ""Art Leaders Forum"" is a collective enterprise of critical inquiry, reflection and open discussion about what it means to lead as an artist now. The implications of assuming leadership are vast----vision, exertion, generosity, intelligence, precision, responsibility, compassion ... Furthermore, to lead cannot mean to ignore the complex reality we live in as a society: Inequity, social disparities, structural racism and discrimination are not undesired mistakes, but structural aspects of the world we live in. In other words, the way our society defines what is ""leadership"" and ""who should lead"" has the power to perpetuate, or for the same matter, dismantle these issues. Our collective inquiry and discussion will inevitably deal with this pressing reality. A group of global art leaders, activists and entrepreneurs from across the globe will join the forum to illustrate, enrich and guide this discussion. The ""Art Leaders Forum"" is a co-creation process in need of every voice and every view that engages in it. Tourism is not an option here: taking part in the forum clearly demands something of each of us----to fully listen and to dare to be heard; to be seen and to see others and their reality.

In dealing with music before 1600, issues of instrumentation, notation, ornamentation, and context are both complicated and crucial, and we will examine the relevant scholarship and recordings.  After 1800, performance issues can be just as difficult to confirm.  One of the goals of the course is to introduce you to the value of using original sources and the many issues ‚Äì execution, context, flexibility, tempo and other markings and choice of instrument ‚Äì that arise from them, so that your own performances take into account the various historical issues that are critical for performing ¬¨‚Äì and teaching ¬¨‚Äì this repertoire.  The seminar-style course will be based around weekly assignments, student presentations, and classroom discussion."
