The aim is to continue to develop graduates who are competent in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning of patients. The course will continue to emphasize a holistic approach to develop competency in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning of patients with a focus on the relationship between oral health and systemic health. Lectures will demonstrate the importance of integrating a patient's medical and dental history with biomedical sciences. The student will demonstrate mastery of biomedical science through an in depth understanding of disease etiology at a molecular or organ systems level, and integrating that into prognosis, risk analysis and treatment. Students learn skills that enable them to evaluate a patient's needs and develop an orderly, prioritized and sequential course of treatment that is problem-based. The student learns to present this information in a way that enables the patient to conceptualize what treatment he or she requires and to co-participate in an informed fashion in the development of their treatment plan. Using faculty supervised seminar presentations, the students develop and present comprehensive programs of dental care. The care is problem based and consists of a recommended plan as well as an alternative plan of therapy. Additionally, the seminar presentation requires a conversation about the patient's medical or physical condition at a molecular or organ systems level that demonstrates the students' knowledge and mastery of biomedical science. The students are required to develop a recommended plan as well as an alternative plan of therapy and support their decisions based on the available evidence in the dental literature. The case presentations facilitate questions and debate, demonstrating students' communication skills and comprehensive understanding of the presented material before peers and other dental professionals."

The students learn skills that enable them to evaluate a patient's needs and develop an orderly, prioritized and sequential course of treatment that is problem-based. They will be able to develop a recommended plan as well as an alternative plan of therapy and support their decisions based on the available evidence in the dental literature. Utilizing treatment plans presented during students' clinical work, the student learns to present this information in a way that enables the patient to conceptualize what treatment and to co-participate in an informed fashion in the development of their treatment plan. The case presentations facilitate questions and debate, demonstrating students' communication skills and comprehensive understanding of the presented material before peers and other dental professionals."
