STH,STH MR 704: Religion and Public Engagement through the Arts,"Because the arts are fundamental to religious expression and are a principal interface between religious communities and the public, this course provides competencies in a wide range of subjects needed for leadership in this field. Primary competencies include an overview of the history of Christian art and architecture in global context; engagement with several methodological frameworks for self-expression and criticism (including aesthetics, semiotics, the creative process, and theopoetics); and foundational skills in the field of arts administration."
STH,STH MR 706: Congregations and Communities,"The increasingly global work of ministry, social activism, and non-profit service often takes place within or alongside religious congregations. Such congregations often serve as local communities, and they are embedded within larger communities such as neighborhoods, ethnic groups, political blocs, and countries. The purpose of this course is to help students understand the significance of religious ""community"" and its role in society, using both sociological and theological resources. We will then focus on pressing issues within U.S. congregational life, including race, class, and gender divides; spiritual pluralism and individualism; and the polarization and decline of Christian organizations."
STH,STH MR 707: The New Testament in Crises: Reading Biblical Texts Amid Contemporary Global Crises,"The Bible is everywhere. The Bible enters political debates through references to biblical authority; it is present in the Museums via artistic references to religious motifs; it informs the so-called cultural wars on sexuality, abortion, reparations, migration, climate change or wealth distribution; it is read weekly by local religious communities across the Globe. Politicians, pastors, activists, artists, writers, and thinkers reach into the biblical past to think about the political, cultural, and social present and the future. The purpose of this course is to explore the ways New Testament texts pervade contemporary debates about contemporary topics, paying attention to how these debates show up in public scholarship."
STH,STH MR 709: The Social Gospel,"This course examines the impact of the theological movement commonly called, the social gospel. Emerging out of the historical context of the late 19th century, the social gospel played a major role in shaping numerous movements of religious-based social activism in the 20th century. In addition to reading important theological voices from this tradition, the course will enable students to examine the social gospel's ongoing influence upon 21st century religious movements. The course will also allow students to engage how the social gospel's legacy can contribute to models of religious leadership today. (Cluster 1 & 2)"
STH,STH MR 711: Disability and Ministry in the Public Square,"This course is about developing leadership skills and practical wisdom that facilitates the welcoming and affirming of people with disabilities into the public square. JÃ¼rgen Habermas defines the public sphere as, ""By 'public sphere' we mean first a domain of our social life in which such a thing as public opinion can be formed."" This course looks at how that public opinion has been formed in terms of disability by examining disability from the vantage point of the three publics originally outlined by Catholic theologian David Tracy: the academy, church, and the public square.

Disability in this course includes everyone covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Discussions and course work will also include hidden disabilities and embodied vulnerability that everyone experiences. This broad focus on disability establishes its relevance and connection to all of us. First, we will focus on the academy and on how to be a theologian and leader who focuses on disability. In this course, we turn our attention to the practice of doing theology as a liberatory praxis to develop an understanding of how disability operates in our culture, and to build practical wisdom and leadership skills to combat ableism. The aim of this course is to help students develop transformative proposals for the church and society. In this exploration, we will pay careful attention to the central themes of disability, namely embodiment and marginalization."
STH,STH MR 713: Ministry and Leadership in Interfaith Contexts,"This course offers an entry point into the emerging field of Interfaith Leadership. It will provide students with an analysis of the power and potential of interfaith leadership in justice work, community building, and personal spiritual maturation. It includes the study and interpretation of historic and contemporary examples of interfaith leadership primarily in the United States, requires students to hone an articulation of their own faith-based motivations for interfaith engagement, and teaches best practices for engagement across differing belief systems. Students will engage in interfaith dialogue as part of their course work. Upon completion of the course, students will have increased their ability to engage in interfaith settings, understand how interfaith leadership differs from intra-faith leadership, and be clear on their individual points of tension in interfaith leadership settings, as well as those of their faith tradition. The course understands interfaith engagement to be inclusive of all people drawn to interfaith efforts including those who do not claim membership or affiliation with a religious tradition."

STH,STH TC 815: Acadia Travel Seminar,"TRAVEL DATES: Monday, May 20 to Sunday, May 26 This course will explore the context of nature as a foundation for spiritual practice. Readings from a variety of faith traditions, including Celtic Christianity and Native American spirituality, will provide the theological grounding for the course. Emphasis will be placed on experiencing and developing individual and communal practices that connect persons to the Holy in and through nature. Students will be guided in experiencing nature as sacred subject rather than object; as teacher, spiritual guide, companion, and neighbor. The settings for this course will be Boston and the Alcyon Center, a spiritual life center in Seal Cove, Maine, just outside the bounds of Acadia National Park, that hosts nature-based retreat experiences (www.alcyoncenter.org) . Four Boston-based sessions will be held on Fridays prior to the travel portion of the course. These sessions will offer theoretical and theological foundations for the travel portion of the course as well as an opportunity to connect with nature in non-wilderness settings. The week after graduation, the class will travel to the Alcyon Center for several days exploring holistic approaches to grounding spiritual practices in nature. With Acadia National Park as a context, students will be led in hikes, nature walks, and other activities exploring how to facilitate such experiences as spiritual practices. Students will also be given the opportunity to reflect upon and engage in the practices and operations of the Alcyon Center, which are based in a rhythm of holy living grounded in nature. These experiences will provide insight into how spiritual traditions can impact more than just programming in such settings. Other class sessions will consider environmental stewardship and sustainability as individual and communal spiritual practices with local resource persons and Alcyon Center staff providing assistance. A follow up session will be held at STH at the beginning of June. Please note: * Each day in Acadia will involve 2-4 miles of hiking, most of which will be easy, but one or two of which could be considered moderately strenuous depending upon one's ability. We will do our best to accommodate persons with differing ability levels, but students should be prepared to undertake this level of activity. * Meals at the Alcyon Center are mostly vegetarian (some chicken and fish) with a good number of gluten-free options (though not prepared in a dedicated GF kitchen). There is ample refrigerator space for students needing to tend to food needs that fall outside these parameters."

STH,STH TC 822: Faith-Based Community Organizing for Justice and Peace,"It is estimated that 1 out of 3 people in a congregation will have some experience with intimate partner violence. It remains the leading reason women visit hospital emergency rooms. Although it is less frequent, men are also victimized. This course will examine the impact of gender based violence on families and congregations. It will give special attention to the general problem of gender based violence and to the role that theological understandings of suffering, obedience, and ownership may play in such violence. It will utilize pastoral counseling case studies (video vignettes of actual pastors) to begin to provide those in ministry with the tools they need to respond to people in their care and understand how to make appropriate referrals."
STH,STH TC 823: Spiritual Guidance in the Christian Tradition,"Are you seeking a ""word of life""? Do you hunger to know more about the wisdom of Christian spiritual traditions? Do you feel called to grow in your ability to guide others? In this course students will explore selected writings from the Christian tradition -- both classic and contemporary. They will read the pithy sayings of the early desert abbas and ammas, the gentle counsel of Francis de Sales, the spiritual teaching of John Wesley and his mother Susanna, and the insights of the Russian pilgrim who wanted to pray without ceasing.

STH,"STH TC 837: Vocation, Work and Faith","Who am I called to become? What am I called to do? What are my gifts and where will they be recognized and of service? These kinds of vocational questions are fundamental to our lives. The course seeks to open up reflection, study, and dialogue about vocation, work, and spirituality in religious traditions and in our own life experience. Work and vocation are often connected. Work too is a crucial religious question in contemporary society. Work exerts a powerful--and often unrecognized--influence on human beings. It can support life, develop talents, elicit creativity, and enable people to contribute to the common good. Work also can demean human beings, undermining their dignity, perpetuating unjust structures, overpowering values, and crowding out other important spheres of life. Labor issues are important concerns for faith communities and faith-based community organizations. This course explores vocation and work as theological/spiritual issues, including implications for ministry. We will explore themes such as: work as spiritual practice or challenge; labor and justice issues; discerning vocation; creativity; Sabbath; ""time poverty""; and work-life balance. The course involves site visits, vocational mentoring, seminar presentations, and individual research/ministry projects. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TC 838: Church Renewal,"In every era, Christians must rethink what it means to be the church in light of the Christian witness and given the unique challenges and opportunities of our particular situation.

The course will employ interdisciplinary study methods, from pastoral/practical theology to cultural studies. Building from these experiences and reflections, students will work to develop practical ministries that aim to restore and heal individuals and communities. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,"STH TC 840: Paradigms of Racism, the Ignorance They Hide, and the Harm They Sustain","Racism is ugly, painful, and seemingly inimical to understanding much less constructive intervention. When it comes to race, people often yell at, talk past, or simply avoid each other. Experiencing frustration, rage, and despair, some fear and may conclude that racism is intractable, even insoluble, while others ""know"" that racism does not exist. This course offers hope, exploring how groups of people form and defend competing systems of truth (that is, ""paradigms"") that hide ignorance and sustain harm. By discussing eight ""paradigms"" of racism and attendant forms of ignorance, we seek to enlarge our understanding as a basis for concrete practical steps that could be taken by different people in different sites. (Cluster 2 or 3)"
STH,STH TC 844: Classics in Christian Spirituality,"This course serves as an introduction to the study of Christian spirituality through in-depth reading of selected classics in Christian spirituality as well as secondary source scholarship in the discipline.

(Clusters 1 or 2)
STH,STH TC 849: Narrative Sermons,"In this course, students will learn approaches to preaching narratively. By the end of the course, students will also begin to integrate their homiletical practice with their own emerging narrative theology of preaching. (Cluster 1 & Cluster 3)"
STH,"STH TC 850: Identity, Preaching, and Leadership in Postcolonial Contexts","This course provides distinctive postcolonial lenses through which students will explore and examine how persons and communities practice intercultural preaching (alternatively, public speech) and leadership in relation to identities: culture, race, gender/sex, religious traditions, and religious communities. Through investigating various historical sociocultural religious traditions and religious leaders in terms of postcolonialism, class, race and sex/gender, students will critically reflect on challenging conditions of power and authority and engage with the complexities of leadership and preaching. Building on these studies and reflections, students will gain a keen sense of understanding different leadership and preaching practices interculturally, and develop their own approaches for their varied contexts and identities. (Clusters 2 or 3)"
STH,STH TC 851: Preaching and Worship in the African-American Traditions,"This course engages students in historical, theological, and practical study of preaching and worship in the Black Church tradition. Readings in black homiletics and practical theologies of worship introduce students to a variety of approaches for the development and delivery of sermons and for the construction and ministerial leadership of worship within black Christian church contexts. Lectures survey theories of the emergence and development of the Black Church tradition in the United States and the social, political, economic, and cultural contexts that shape contemporary ministerial praxis in black churches. Site visits, guest lectures by practitioners, and examination of audio-visual media will augment the readings and lectures in order to enrich students' appreciation and understanding of the practical nuances of preaching and worship within the diverse experiences of black Christian faith communities.

An ecumenical and international approach will be taken in studying both historic and contemporary rites. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TC 865: Disability and Theology,"This workshop serves as an introduction to disability as it relates to the study of theology and the practices of ministry. The purpose of this workshop is to expose students to people with disabilities through narratives, film clips and a panel discussion to help students think through the theological issues disability raises while developing potential responses to future encounters with people with disabilities. To this end the workshop will first explore the question: ""What is disability?"" as it has been defined from historic, social and medical perspectives. The workshop will explore disability through a theological lens exploring concepts, such as, creation, theological anthropology, and theodicy while attempting to answer critical theological questions related to disability. The workshop extends the reflection on disability and theology into the practices of ministry. This will involve reflection upon the meaning of welcoming and inclusion, worship and preaching when examined through the lens of disability. Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TC 867: Theology and Popular Culture,"This course places the Christian gospel into dialogue with a variety of expressions of North American popular culture (film, television, art, music, entertainment, sports, etc.) in an effort to understand the complex relationship between the two. The course takes up at with this dialogue against the wider background of the study of religion and popular culture and by exploring the nature of self and transcendence, morality and the spiritual quest as those are constructed and configured within popular culture. The course asks to what extent contemporary expressions of Christian worship, preaching, Ministry, evangelism, and spirituality might better engage popular culture and to what extent these expressions already reflected the values, patterns, and practices of popular culture. (Clusters 1 and 2)"
STH,"STH TC 869: Prophetic Preaching, Pastoral Ministry, and Social Change","This course is designed to help students wrestle with several central issues around prophetic preaching in contemporary Christian churches: the relationships of prophetic preaching to the gospel, to the Bible, to the social-political context, and to pastoral ministry generally. Since the course is designed to be a seminar, students will be expected to wrestle with these issues not only in class but also through a sermon and a public message. By the end of the course, students should be able to develop their own vision for prophetic preaching in a way that integrates the above concerns by moving from a specific Biblical text to a sermon as well as a public message in light of a situation. Pre-requisite TC715 Intro to Preaching or its equivalent. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TC 870: Women/femmes and leadership,"This course aims to deconstruct and demystify ""leadership"", encourage active participation in discovering individual and communal leadership styles, and expand how we approach leadership through the lens of women/femmes. (cluster 2 & 3)"

(Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TC 880: Claim Your Superpower for Ministry,"In this leadership development workshop, students engage in discerning and more fully owning their ""superpower"" for ministry--an extraordinary ability at the heart of one's vocation to perceive, analyze, and respond to harm that others ignore. Drawing on feminist epistemology and practical theology, the workshop provides tools and case studies in Christian ministry. We explore the complex and sometimes hidden origin of one's superpower, the challenges of drawing on it as a leader, the importance of learning from others, and the wisdom of helping others discern and more fully own their superpower. Notice the word their in the last line is italicized for emphasis."
STH,STH TC 899: Practicing Justice,"This course explores the nature of social justice and its place within the mission of the church by: a) surveying the varied conceptions, contexts, and practical contours of justice in contemporary societies; and b) investigating key theological and religio-critical perspectives on the historical, biblical, and theological foundations of social justice as a constitutive attribute of Christian community and Christian ministry. Upon this examination, the church's pursuit of social justice emerges as a multifaceted practice that disturbs traditional distinctions between the prophetic and priestly dimensions of the church's identity. Through careful attention to the required texts, as well as the conduct of student research and constructive reflection, course participants are encouraged to rediscover the practice of seeking justice as an art of ministry -- as a dance through which prophetic and priestly activities engage one another as partners. (MDiv Practicing Faith Section) (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TC 906: Situational Preaching,"This course is designed with occasional and situational preaching in view. It presupposes the probability of both recurring and unique situations in which the gospel (the ""good news,"" not the final lection in the ecumenical order) must be preached in a way both clear and arresting. To deal with this presupposition, the course will deal with preaching the gospel when some situational feature of congregational or organizational life demands attention. Indirectly, it is also an exploration of theological method. In whatever situation, the preaching task will be viewed as a theological one, i.e., as an opportunity for discerning the import of and articulating the gospel anew in a given situation. Thus students will be equipped to be ""theologians of the Word"" who can interpret situations from a variety of viewpoints, evaluate the usefulness of various tools for preaching in light of the gospel and then employ them fruitfully. In order to do this, we will work on the following tools: 1. Bringing to critical awareness our own understandings of the gospel, 2. Developing skills and resources as contextual theologians in residence, , and 3. Developing skills and resources as homiletical exegetes of situations. As a result students should develop greater pastoral sensitivity, rhetorical savvy and think-on-your-feet theological acumen while preparing for preaching in a context in which transformational theological leadership needs to be exercised."

STH,STH TC 914: Worship in Times of Change,"Birth, maturation, sickness, and death are life changes that are addressed ritually in most human societies and cultures. Christian communities, though initially slow to do so, have introduced worship events/liturgies that speak the Gospel in such times of crisis or change- -those human as well as institutional. Even so, new occasions or circumstances arise in each generation where Christian communities may be called upon to supply ritual interventions that both sustain and transform. This course will focus on contemporary rites addressing human and institutional ""life-cycle passages,"" which will be examined and evaluated with attention to contextual, theological, liturgical, ritual, and pastoral criteria.

STH,STH TR 802: The Sociology of Religion,"This course will introduce students to the basic ideas and methods with which sociologists have analyzed the relationship between religion and society. It will explore what it means to think about religious language, symbols, communities, and practices a social phenomenon. We will also explore the social processes at work in congregations and denominations, new religious movements and conversion, religious communal identity and ethnic conflict. (Cluster 2)"
STH,STH TR 813: Congregations and Communities,"The increasingly global and transnational work of ministry, social activism, and non-profit service often takes place within or alongside religious congregations. Such congregations function as communities, and are in turn embedded within larger communities such as neighborhoods, ethnic groups, political blocs, and countries. The purpose of this course is to help students theorize religious ""community"" in a sophisticated and nuanced way, as well as introduce concepts and methods for the engaged sociological study of congregations within their international contexts.

It will function much like a workshop, providing extensive guided practice with project conceptualization and design, finding funding, meeting university ethics requirements, gaining access to communities, recruiting participants, managing and storing data, creating coding schemes and using software, integrating mixed types of data to support an argument, balancing ""home"" and ""field,"" being reflexive, and exercising respect and care for both oneself and one's interlocutors. Relative attention to these issues will depend on the needs and interests of the students. It can fruitfully be taken either separately or in addition to TR 800, Ethnographic Research. (Cluster 2)"
STH,STH TR 850: Social Science Approaches to Religion and Spirituality,"The social sciences offer a robust set of paradigms, methods, and insights useful for understanding religious and spiritual lives. Whether our goal is to deepen appreciation, articulate critique, or pursue transformation of religious institutions; to become better religious leaders; or to further our spiritual growth and healing, social science approaches can help us identify and interpret the broader contexts of religion and spirituality and better reflect on our relevant experiences. They also provide methods for studying religion and spirituality that are increasingly employed in multidisciplinary fields such as practical theology, social ethics, and pastoral psychology. This course provides an overview of social science approaches and methods with a special focus on sociology. Students will learn how to digest, interpret, and employ social science research in the service of their professional goals, and will begin to develop methodological skills for use in their own scholarship."
STH,STH TR 900: Ethnographic Research,"This seminar aims to train students in the understanding and application of ethnographic research methods. The research methods covered in this course are qualitative in nature, focusing on projects which require practitioners to go into the field and to analyze social spaces constructed, inhabited, and maintained by particular sets of social actors. The data in focus is less readily accessible via surveys, demographic analysis, and experimental designs. Course participants will, first of all, gain a broad understanding of the traditions related to ethnography, fieldwork, and qualitative research in the field of sociology. Secondly, participants will engage key debates in sociology related to the theories and methods of ethnographic work, ultimately developing research designs that most effectively fit personal projects in progress. Thirdly, participants will expand their techniques of data collection via guided field assignments and class interactions. Fourthly, participants will develop practices of research presentation that communicate findings in a compelling and insightful manner, with the aim of making findings accessible to a broader academic audience. Throughout the course, special attention will be given to the observation of how social boundaries are constructed and maintained in particular social settings."
STH,STH TS 803: Literature and Ethics,"Good ethical conception and practice often demand that we see things from others' points of view. Great novels, plays, poems, and films are good at helping us to reach empathic perceptions of particular people and situations by involving our intellect and emotion. Novels, tragic dramas, and others have the capacity to make readers identify with fictional characters in ways that show possibilities and potential vulnerabilities for themselves. This kind of empathic identification is important for good ethical practice in diverse and pluralistic communities. Narrative works of art are important for developing the human self- understanding critical for embodying certain religious and theological ideals. This course will explore the connections between literature (novels, plays, and short stories) and ethics: the relationship between creative imagination and moral imagination; the nature of moral attention and moral vision; the role of context-specific judging in ethical decisions. The course will help students to deepen and broaden their ethical understanding in ways that involve and give priority to context-specific moral evaluation, compassion, similar possibilities and vulnerabilities, eudaimonistic judgment, rather than abstract general principles for ethical judgment. (Clusters 1 and 2)"
STH,STH TS 805: Introduction to Conflict Transformation,"This course is a response to the experience of destructive conflict in the church and in the world, as well as the experience of religion as a source of conflict.

In addition to classroom experience, students will complete an 8 hour practicum in the Barnstable Courts under the supervision of Cape Mediation staff (see details below). (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TS 808: Spirit and Ethics,"This course equips students with necessary skills to address this crucial question from Christian theology and ethics: How does (does not) the Spirit empower religious-ethical life that engenders social transformation of societies? Students will engage with the work of leading social ethicists, theologians, political theorists, continental philosophers, and scholars of religion who are conceptualizing, rethinking, or even resisting the notion of God's Spirit as an agent in history. We will undertake close readings and critical reflections on the creative thoughts of intellectuals influencing and shaping the discourse on Spirit in the twenty-first century. The course will enable participants to radically re-imagine pneumatology and to deploy it as a resource for liberatory praxis and creative moral deliberations necessary for critical engagements with late capitalism, democracy, pluralism, public policies, and structures of domination and oppression in their own communities. (Clusters 1 and 2)"
STH,STH TS 811: Economics and Ethics,"This course is structured to provide students with the basic awareness and understanding of economic ideas, issues, and practices as they intersect with faith and ethics in all spheres of life. Economics and Ethics will enable students to better comprehend the existing economic order of being in their societies and to help them craft theologically-informed modes of resistance to social injustice and obstacles to human flourishing. It will teach students the basic concepts of economics in ways that would equip them to not only grasp the economic foundations of Christian thinking about moral decisions, but also prepare them to minister to professionals, business executives, and corporate leaders in a globalizing world. The course will also help students to respond to one of the major challenges in the marketplace: how can we develop frameworks and models to enable business executives live ethically and faithfully in the complex and pluralistic corporate world? âââ (Clusters 2 and 3)"

STH,STH TS 816: Paul and Continental Philosophers,"Non-Christians and atheists have interpreted Paul's work in ways that have deepened our understanding of politics and social ethics of Christianity and even the legacy of Christian thought on radical philosophy and revolutionary thought. We will, among others, critically engage with the works of French philosophers Alain Badiou and Jean Luc-Nancy, Italian thinker Giorgio Agamben, and Slovenian radical scholar Slavoj ?i? ek, who are some of today's leading interpreters of Paul and his influence on political theology/philosophy, community, messianism, subjectivity, and social transformation. We will also study the works of scholars within the Christian tradition who are picking on some of their radical insights and bringing them into theology, social ethics, and biblical studies. All these new forms of scholarship making provocative proposals about society and political philosophy prompt a re-turn to classical readings of Christian texts in order to strengthen and broaden our knowledge of Christian thought as it applies to transformative praxis. Students will be encouraged to approach their study in this course with some particular social-political problem in mind so as to discern more readily the implications of the new interpretations of Paul's theological thought for dealing with contemporary moral issues. (Cluster 1 & 2)"
STH,STH TS 833: Social Justice,"This course seeks to probe the internal debates and contemporary promise of major social movements for the marginalized and dispossessed. We will first survey Aristotelian, biblical, classical liberal, Marxist, and Rawlsian formulations of justice. We then read some foundational texts redressing injustices based on class, race, gender, sexuality, education, disability, indigeneity, and environmental placement. Finally, we examine three prominent religious voices for social justice: the Levellers, Ranters, and Diggers for radical egalitarianism; the Black social gospel for racial equality; and Catholic Worker movement for labor rights. (Cluster 1&2)"

STH,STH TS 848: Global Pentacostalism,"The last 50 years have seen the explosion of Pentecostal-Charismatic type churches in the world, becoming not only the fastest growing segment of Christianity, but also the vanguard of the global Christian movement. This is a basic course on the theology, ethics, and history of the worldwide Pentecostal-Charismatic renewal movements. It offers a historical-descriptive approach of the movements in various countries, theological analyses of their doctrines and beliefs, a sociological investigation of their religious techniques, and an ethical study of their social actions and political spiritualities. Students will learn how Pentecostal-Charismatic movements are transforming themselves to be a major positive force for social justice in this- worldly realm. Drawing on readings from religious studies, theology, politics, sociology, and anthropology, this course seeks to transcend disciplinary boundaries to enable students to better understand Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, their recent histories, and their potentials for renewal of Christianity across denominational lines and across the Catholic- Protestant divide.

STH,"STH TS 857: Ethics, Spirituality & Technology","This class concerns the ethics of emerging technologies of spiritual enhancement. There is a lot more going on than you may realize, from brain stimulation to neurofeedback-guided meditation, and from psychedelics to technodelics, and it is all complicated -- technologically, medically, economically, theologically, and especially ethically. Religious leaders, chaplains, journalists, and just about everyone needs to know about technologies of spiritual enhancement. By moving through the array of new and emerging technologies systematically, analyzing the science, practice, and ethics of each offering, we can come to grips with these profound changes in the worlds of religion and spirituality. This class is recommended for STH masters students heading into positions of religious leadership, COM students working in religion or science journalism, and anyone working in ethics seeking a basic understanding of the brave new world of consciousness hacking and enlightenment engineering, and what it means for all of us. (Cluster 1)"
STH,STH TS 875: Comparative Religious Ethics,"Comparative religious ethics, as a burgeoning academic field, strives to pursue moral wisdom across religious boundaries. In this course, we first juxtapose the ethical teaching of Christianity with another tradition to probe some perennial moral questions: ultimate end, exemplary virtue, social hierarchy, sexuality and marriage, war and peace, as well as political liberation. We then examine some contemporary issues comparatively in feminist, environmental, and postcolonial ethics. Finally, we study the moral significance of religious traditions as ""spiritual exercises"" (in the senses given by St. Ignatius and Pierre Hadot). There, we explore how bodily practices such as yogic movements, breathing exercises, Benedictine liturgical prayers, meditation of the cosmos, and contemplation of divine love might have far-reaching ethical consequences. (Cluster 1 & 2)"
STH,STH TS 877: The Principles and Practices of Restorative Justice,"A study of the fundamental principles and practices of restorative justice as applicable to church and society. The course explores the needs and roles of key stakeholders (victims, offenders, communities, justice systems), outlines the basic principles and values of restorative justice, introduces some of the primary models of practice, and identifies challenges to restorative justice and strategies to respond to them. The course is organized around the issue of crime and harm within a western legal context, but attention is given to applications in other contexts. Of particular interest is the contribution of traditional or indigenous approaches to justice as well as applications in post-conflict situations. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TS 881: Environmental Justice,"This course explores the ways in which injustices are mediated through our physical environment, and how academics, artists, ordinary citizens, organizers, and religious leaders are addressing those injustices. Through articles, case studies, discussion, writing, and excursions to encounter the the work of the environmental justice movement in Boston, we will explore how communities engage (or avoid engaging) the connection between environmental and public health. We will explore how environmental justice activists navigate the complex webs of different stakeholders and analyze the ways that power and voice relate to environmental health. By the end of this course, you will have developed your own creative response to an instance of environmental injustice and have joined the other academics and activists at work in this vital field.

This course will introduce students to the theology, theory and practice of faith-based conflict transformation, preparing students to become religious leaders equipped with fundamental tools and skills for engaging conflict and transforming conflict in a way that advances God's goal of shalom, a culture of justpeace."
STH,STH TT 731: Theology & World Religions,"As students, scholars, spiritual seekers and religious leaders we live in a modern world manifesting many forms of diversity. One key form of this diversity is religious pluralism. We become more and more aware that that, for instance, all the historical religions of the world now comprise the spiritual mosaic of spiritual life in North America. This course provides an overview of the historical development of the world's religions in order to better understand the current spiritual pluralism of North America. While the history of world religions does not explain everything that is happening in the lives of modern religious people, informed understanding of these religions is still essential for anyone who seeks to dialogue in a meaningful fashion with a person of another faith tradition. The course will focus on both the emic (inner dimensions) and etic (outer dimensions) of the historical and spiritual development of the world's religions. We will stress the differences as well as the similar features of the religions. We will also ask genuine theological questions because we live, work, communicate and minister in diverse religious communities of faith. (Requires TF 701/TF 702 as prerequisite.) (Cluster 1)"
STH,STH TT 732: History of Christian Theology in Philosophical Perspective,"In its nearly two-millennium long history, Christian theology has been shaped by its dynamic engagements with (and in) various traditions of philosophical reflection. In this course, students will examine how four such traditions-- Platonic, Aristotelian, Kantian/Phenomenological, and Marxist/Critical--have influenced (and been influenced by) theological questions, concepts, and modes of discourse.

STH,STH TT 733: Constructive Theology,"This course introduces students to the major themes of Christian theology with the aim of providing them with a framework for effective and faithful theological reflection. Beginning with revelation and ending with eschatology, we follow a familiar progression in the study of systematic theology, examining modern and postmodern theological perspectives on God, creation, human nature, sin, Christology, ecclesiology and other doctrinal loci. The methodological approach is constructive, in that emphasis is placed on helping students integrate central issues of faith in response to contemporary issues. (Requires TF 701/TF 702 as prerequisite.) (Cluster 1)"
STH,STH TT 807: Christian Eschatology in Post-Apocalyptic Times,"This course explores the Christian eschatological imagination through engagements with pre-modern and contemporary texts dealing with the theological category of the future. Students will be encouraged to reflect how visions of the future inform particular (and often ambiguous) social and political dispositions and sensibilities. The course will further offer resources for constructive readings of Christian eschatology and invite students to develop creative appropriations of the vocabulary of Christian eschatology. Course will include an overview of biblical, Patristic, and medieval sources as a basis from which the vocabulary of Christian eschatology was constructed.

Questions of particular importance are: (1) How strong are traditional and new atheistic arguments? (2) Where does or should theology stand in relation to the arguments of atheism? (3) What are the origins of modern atheism? (4) Should postmodern mystical theologies and iconoclastic anti-anthropomorphic theologies that reject a determinate divine being be considered atheistic? If so how does this sort of atheism relate to other types? The class is intended for advanced masters students and doctoral candidates interested in con-temporary theology and its conceptual roots in older theological debates. Meets with STH TT 956.

(Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent) (Cluster 1)"
STH,STH TT 826: Political Theology,"Recent developments across a variety of disciplines have led to deep and widespread interest in ""political theology"" -- a diverse range of approaches to interrogating, (re)imagining, and (de)constructing the intersection of politics, religion, and theology, present and past. Scholars have argued that dominant paradigms of sovereignty, the secular, modernity, and liberalism are themselves secularized, corrupted, or otherwise transformed versions of Jewish and Christian theology. Others contend that modern political practices and paradigms represent not the legacy of early modern secularization but the trail of an early modern reinjection of theology in political and social theory. Others still find in the practices of contemporary communities lived political theologies that subvert existing power structures and cast doubt on common conceptions of contemporary political life and possibilities. This course examines these competing developments, readings, and proposals; their interactions; and the contested histories, theories, and values that underwrite them. Considering political theology as both a historical and contemporary phenomenon and engaging a range of perspectives and figures, the course also considers relations and interactions between political theology and other approaches to questions of ""religion and politics."" (Cluster 1)"
STH,STH TT 829: Thomas Aquinas,"Thomas Aquinas is one of the most important figures in the history and development of Western philosophy and Christian theology. On nearly everything he writes about -- from virtue to the sacraments, metaphysics of identity to the incarnation, war to soteriology -- he has something interesting, important, and illuminating to say. And whether one agrees with his particular conclusions or not, it is difficult to engage his work without growing as a thinker and reader. This doctoral seminar constitutes an extended engagement with Thomas's thought, primarily through attention to his Summa theologiae. Engagement with secondary sources will be sparing so as to keep our focus on the text itself. We will be reading with an eye to understanding Thomas both on his own terms and as a resource for contemporary work in philosophy, theology, and religious studies. The course's focus this year is on Thomas's ethics (especially his conceptions of virtue, habit, and human action); the relations between his ethics and his overarching theological and intellectual project; and the ongoing philosophical and theological interest of these dimensions of his thought. The course is suitable both for advanced Aquinas students as well as those new to his thought. (Cluster 1)"

STH,"STH TT 876: God, Good, and the Good Life","This course explores the relations among God, good, and the good life as they have been conceived by a number of important and influential contemporary moral philosophers and religious ethicists -- theists and non-theists alike. In so doing, the course examines various ways of mapping the relations between philosophy and theology or faith and reason, while also casting doubt on efforts to neatly separate the two. The course especially attends to ways in which believers and nonbelievers alike have imagined the difference God makes (or fails to make) when it comes to ethics, considered both as an intellectual discipline and as way of being in the world. It considers too the ways these figures have inherited and transformed some of the most important pre-modern philosophical and religious traditions in their own efforts to do ethics in today's world. (Cluster 1)"
STH,STH TT 898: Theology and Trauma,"This course aims to bring the recent studies in the interdisciplinary study of trauma to bear on the field of theology. What unique challenges does the phenomenon of trauma pose to contemporary theology? The first part of the course explores recent studies in trauma, focusing on three areas of research: 1) neurobiology of trauma, 2) clinical/therapeutic studies, and 3) literary approaches to trauma. The second part of the course examines theological engagements with issues of radical suffering. The third part brings together the insights from the first two and focuses on the question of what it means to witness theologically to individual, societal, and global trauma. We will look at issues and contexts such as the criminal justice system, war, poverty, and racism. In this final part, students will be working towards constructive theological engagements with issues of trauma through interaction with a variety of mediums: art, literature, spiritual practices, and film. The course is not a counseling course. It aims to provide rich theological reflection around issues of suffering, violence, and trauma, both individual and global. (Requires TF 701/702 or equivalent) (Clusters 1 and 2)"
STH,STH TT 926: Political Theology,"Recent developments across a variety of disciplines have led to deep and widespread interest in ""political theology"" -- a diverse range of approaches to interrogating, (re)imagining, and (de)constructing the intersection of politics, religion, and theology, present and past. Scholars have argued that dominant paradigms of sovereignty, the secular, modernity, and liberalism are themselves secularized, corrupted, or otherwise transformed versions of Jewish and Christian theology. Others contend that modern political practices and paradigms represent not the legacy of early modern secularization but the trail of an early modern reinjection of theology in political and social theory. Others still find in the practices of contemporary communities lived political theologies that subvert existing power structures and cast doubt on common conceptions of contemporary political life and possibilities. This course examines these competing developments, readings, and proposals; their interactions; and the contested histories, theories, and values that underwrite them. Considering political theology as both a historical and contemporary phenomenon and engaging a range of perspectives and figures, the course also considers relations and interactions between political theology and other approaches to questions of ""religion and politics."""
STH,STH TT 929: Thomas Aquinas,"Thomas Aquinas is one of the most important figures in the history and development of Western philosophy and Christian theology. On nearly everything he writes about -- from virtue to the sacraments, metaphysics of identity to the incarnation, war to soteriology -- he has something interesting, important, and illuminating to say. And whether one agrees with his particular conclusions or not, it is difficult to engage his work without growing as a thinker and reader. This doctoral seminar constitutes an extended engagement with Thomas's thought, primarily through attention to his Summa theologiae. Engagement with secondary sources will be sparing so as to keep our focus on the text itself. We will be reading with an eye to understanding Thomas both on his own terms and as a resource for contemporary work in philosophy, theology, and religious studies. The course's focus this year is on Thomas's ethics (especially his conceptions of virtue, habit, and human action); the relations between his ethics and his overarching theological and intellectual project; and the ongoing philosophical and theological interest of these dimensions of his thought. The course is suitable both for advanced Aquinas students as well as those new to his thought."
STH,STH TT 932: Paul Tillich,"Centered on one of the major theological works of the twentieth century, the Systematic Theology, this course is designed to assist students to contextualize, interpret, and analyze the thought of Paul Tillich and to assess its significance for contemporary theology."
STH,STH TT 940: Ecclesiology,"This course asks the question, ?What is the church?? in dialogue with Christian theological figures and schools representing Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian traditions. While one of the aims of this course is that students be conversant with those voices, it ultimately aims at the student's ability to articulate the ecclesiology of his or her own community and to bring that to bear on the contemporary situation and particular problems of Christian practice in church and society. Meets with TJ940."
STH,STH TT 956: Atheisms and Theologies,"The general aim of this course is learn about varieties of atheism-older ""classic atheism,"" so-called ""new atheism"" of recent years, and theologically inspired forms of atheism-and to understand the various theological responses to atheism. Questions of particular importance are: (1) How strong are traditional and new atheistic arguments? (2) Where does or should theology stand in relation to the arguments of atheism? (3) What are the origins of modern atheism? (4) Should postmodern mystical theologies and iconoclastic anti-anthropomorphic theologies that reject a determinate divine being be considered atheistic? If so how does this sort of atheism relate to other types? The class is intended for advanced masters students and doctoral candidates interested in con-temporary theology and its conceptual roots in older theological debates. Meets with STH TT 816."

STH,STH TY 704: Spiritual Care,"Spiritual care is the art of ministry, chaplaincy, and counseling as it relates to the theological, psychological, and sociocultural needs of individuals and communities of faith. This course introduces various theories, methods, and practices of spiritual care and cognate disciplines for students to interpret and examine individuals and their communities as they are shaped by their own communal and sociocultural contexts. Students will have an opportunity to explore some of the personal, interpersonal, and communal issues that spiritual caregivers encounter as they engage in the work of care within congregations, hospitals, schools, the military, workplaces, and faith-based agencies. Furthermore, because of its deep commitment to social justice, spiritual care pays close attention to how social advantages and disadvantages contribute to unjust policies and systems that produce injustices based on class, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or other aspects of one's social identity.

STH,STH TY 803: The Psychology of Religion,Examining methodological questions and issues in the psychological interpretation of religious matters by considering what is meant by 'religion' and what is involved in interpreting 'religion' psychologically. (Cluster 2)
STH,STH TY 806: Theories of Human Development,"The goal of this course is to achieve an understanding of the human developmental process and how that process integrates the growth of faith and the life of the community. We will use a series of theoretical readings, broader lectures by the professor, and selected autobiographies to apply theory. As our experiences provide excellent laboratory data, there will be various opportunities to examine our own life processes as a way of seeing theory in action. Course Objectives: By the end of the class, students should: - know the primary developmental theories, including psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, social learning, faith development and be able to identity of variety of lesser used theories - be able to critique developmental theories using the insights of feminist theory, studies in racism and sexual identity, and the reality of globalization - be able to apply theory to case material - discuss the relationship of human development and community context. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TY 811: Object Relations and the Study of Religion,"Achieving familiarity with and fluency in a series of psychoanalytic theories of personality/character, development, relationships, motivation, health, and pathology, as a context in which to practice psychoanalytic interpretations of religious matters. (Cluster 2)"
STH,STH TY 826: Couple and Family Dynamics,"This is an introductory course that includes a comprehensive overview of the field of family systems and family therapy. This course will serve as an introduction to the theory and techniques of couples and family therapy.

Students will have the opportunity to reflect upon how they might actually use course content professionally in their respective disciplines. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,"STH TY 833: Reading Lives: Story, Autobiography, and Identity","The course offers an in-depth study of narrative theories from a broad range of fields encompassing disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Students will be introduced to integrative concepts from narrative psychology, narrative therapy, literary studies, narrative (virtue) ethics, narrative gerontology, and narrative medicine to understand the importance of human stories, beliefs, values, and meanings. For the past thirty years, pastoral theologians and spiritual caregivers have engaged narrative theories to understand human identity and experience by listening to and examining stories of individuals and communities. More recently in narrative approaches to spiritual care, scholars and practitioners in religion engage the insights of critical theory to deconstruct harmful narratives and find ways to create more life-giving narratives, especially for individuals and communities from historically marginalized contexts. By exploring the history, theories, and methods of narrative spiritual care, students will be able to think deeply and broadly about its ramifications in ministry and life. (Cluster 2 & 3)"
STH,STH TY 842: Pastoral Psychology of Healing,"Every person, in her or his personal relationships and professional activities, is guided by a complex, often tacit, theory of healing, comprised of judgments about illness/suffering (what's wrong?); health/well-being (what's possible? what's ideal?); the trajectory from one to the other (how do we get there?); and factors that enhance as well as inhibit movement along that trajectory (what should we do?). Examining and comparing a range of theories of healing--in psychology, medicine, Christian traditions, world religions, and non-Western cultures--equips us critically to reflect upon, amend, if not reconstruct our respective theories of healing. (Clusters 2 and 3)"
STH,STH TY 860: Introduction to Chaplaincy,"Organized around three competencies (interpersonal, organizational, and meaning- making), this focuses on the unique dimensions of what it means to provide spiritual care in public settings. The course provides opportunities for students: 1) to identify strengths they bring to the work; 2) explore various sectors of chaplaincy; 3) interact with working chaplains; and 4) engage historical, contemporary, and future-forecasting research on spiritual care in North America. The course is highly recommended for students pursuing chaplaincy, those discerning vocation in this area, and working chaplains eager for further study. The course also welcomes those who are not pursuing chaplaincy as a vocation and interested in the practice of spiritual care in public spaces. (Cluster 1 & 2)"
